# Episode  22 -- Alison and Jonah Brooks on Having a Transgender Partner and Parent

<article style=""><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/eea6ff0aa1fcf849bee56b82548b6605f5600843.jpg" /></article>

On this episode of Tiny Conversations I talk to **Jonah **and **Alison Brooks **about having a transgender parent and partner. I wasn't until Dee and Alison were married, and Jonah was born, that **Dee **realized she was transgender and came out to both **Alison **and **Jonah**.

On this episode I talk to **Alison **about what it was like to learn this about her partner and go through a divorce. I ask **Jonah **what it was like for him to learn about this at age 6, and what it's like for him now at age 11\.
