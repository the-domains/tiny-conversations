# Episode 21 -- Alex Blumberg on Telling Emotional Stories

<article style=""><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8e1c3199afee3fe5f3891243406ed1693d563f27.jpg" /></article>

On this episode of Tiny Conversations I talk to **Alex Blumberg**. If you don't know who**Alex Blumberg**is, chances are you're familiar with his work. He's a former producer for radio shows like [This American Life][0], [Planet Money][1], and most recently the Podcast [Start Up][2].

**Alex's**success in radio and podcasting can best be attributed to his ability to tell great stories. What's kind of awesome is that he quite generously will tell you what he believes makes a good story -- emotion and anecdote. On this episode I call**Alex**on the phone and talk to him about what it takes to get an emotional story and make exceptional audio stories.

**Alex**runs a company called Gimlet that produces three amazing podcasts. You can find and listen to all three [here][3]. If you know someone who would be great on this Podcast, please send [an email][4] or tweet [@briancauley][5]. You can also subscribe to this Podcast in [iTunes][6], [Stitcher][7] and pretty much anywhere else.

_Our theme music is provided by [Broke for Free][8]._
