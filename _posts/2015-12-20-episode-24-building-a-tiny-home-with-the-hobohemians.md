**Kat Walters** and **Matthew Davey** about their project to build a tiny home. The two call themselves [the Hobohemians][0] and they are building a 8′ x 20′ house on a flatbed trailer.

**Kat **and **Matt** first made the decision to build and then live in this home after a cross-continent tour in a camper smaller than the size of their future house. The experience changed them and their perspectives on living. I sat down with the two and spoke to them about how this project started, where it's going, and how some of their values have changed.
